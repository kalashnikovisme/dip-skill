# dip-skill

Use this skill to configure or update a project's local development environment with `dip` (`https://github.com/bibendi/dip`).

## Core behavior

1. Detect the current tech stack.
2. Check that the development environment is isolated from production, staging, and other critical resources.
3. Select and execute the matching recipe.
4. Keep changes minimal and aligned with existing project conventions.

## Stack detection rules

Inspect repository files in this order:

1. **Ruby on Rails**
   - `Gemfile` includes `gem "rails"` (or equivalent)
   - `config/application.rb` exists
2. **Node.js**
   - `package.json` exists
   - If `package.json` contains `next`, prefer the **Next.js** recipe below
3. **Django**
   - `manage.py` exists, or
   - `pyproject.toml` / `requirements*.txt` contains `django`
4. **Python (non-Django)**
   - `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `setup.py` exists
5. **Unknown**
   - None of the above patterns match

If multiple stacks match, prioritize framework-specific recipes (`Rails`, `Django`, `Next.js`) over generic ones.

## Mandatory Rails handoff

If the project is Ruby on Rails, do **not** continue with this skill recipes.  
Respond with:

- A clear recommendation to use `tramway-skill` instead:  
  `https://github.com/Purple-Magic/tramway-skill/`
- A short reason: it is purpose-built for Rails and provides better Rails-specific workflows.

## Mandatory: no direct Docker commands

Never use `docker` or `docker compose` commands directly. All container operations must go through `dip`. Use `dip compose` for any Compose sub-command (e.g. `dip compose build`, `dip compose up`, `dip compose run`, `dip compose exec`). If a workflow cannot be expressed through `dip`, stop and ask the user rather than falling back to raw Docker commands.

## Recipe execution policy

- Before running provisioning, migrations, seed tasks, or any command that can mutate data, complete the critical-resource safety check below.
- Put newly created development configuration files under `.dockerdev/`, except `dip.yml`, which must stay at the repository root.
- Prefer updating existing `dip.yml` / compose files over replacing them.
- Reuse existing service names and ports when possible.
- Avoid destructive edits.
- After changes, provide exact `dip` commands for provisioning and daily workflow.
- Update the target project's `README.md` with the `dip` commands this skill implemented or changed.
- Update the target project's `README.md` with OS-specific Dip installation instructions.

## Mandatory configuration placement

When creating new development configuration, place `dip.yml` at the repository root and place all supporting development configuration files in `.dockerdev/`.

Generated files include:

- `dip.yml`
- `.dockerdev/compose.yml`
- `.dockerdev/Dockerfile.dev`
- `.dockerdev/.env.example` and `.dockerdev/.env` when local env templates or local-only defaults are needed
- Any helper SQL, bootstrap, development-only config files, or scripts created for the `dip` workflow

Do not create new root-level `docker-compose.yml`, `compose.yml`, `Dockerfile.dev`, `.env.example`, or helper script files for this workflow. If a project already has root-level supporting development config, merge with or reference it only when that is safer than duplicating behavior, and document the decision.

Because `dip.yml` stays at the repository root, document normal `dip` commands such as `dip provision`, `dip up`, and `dip test`. Keep paths inside root `dip.yml` valid from the repository root; reference the compose file as `.dockerdev/compose.yml`. For the compose file at `.dockerdev/compose.yml`, use `context: ..`, `dockerfile: .dockerdev/Dockerfile.dev`, and bind mounts such as `..:/app`.

If scripts are needed for waiting on services, bootstrapping databases, applying migrations, or other repeatable development tasks, create them under `.dockerdev/scripts/`. These scripts must be written in the project's main language and must start with the matching executable shebang, for example `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` for Ruby projects, `#!/usr/bin/env node` for JavaScript/TypeScript projects, or `#!/usr/bin/env python3` for Python projects. Use shell scripts only when shell is the project's main language or when there is no practical runtime available in the app image. Reference those scripts from `dip.yml` with paths that work when commands execute from the repository root.

## Mandatory critical-resource safety check

Every generated or updated development workflow must be isolated from production, staging, and other critical environments.

Before writing final `dip` commands or running any mutable command:

1. Inspect existing local-development inputs, including `dip.yml`, compose files, Dockerfiles, `.env.example`, committed env templates, framework config, package scripts, and documented setup commands.
2. Look for references to critical resources, including production or staging database URLs, hosted Postgres/Supabase/Redis/Elasticsearch endpoints, cloud storage buckets, queues, payment providers, email/SMS providers, analytics projects, or any env var names/values that clearly target shared infrastructure.
3. Ensure generated defaults point to local containers or explicitly local emulators only, such as `db`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, Docker service names, or placeholder local-only credentials.
4. Do not copy real secrets or critical URLs from `.env`, shell history, deployment files, CI variables, or ignored files into generated config or docs.
5. If a critical resource is detected or cannot be ruled out, stop before running mutable commands. Report the exact file/key or command that appears risky, replace generated defaults with local placeholders where safe, and ask the user to confirm the intended local resource before continuing.

For database and migration commands, the safety check is mandatory. Never run migrations, resets, seeds, destructive SQL, queue workers, sync jobs, or one-off scripts when the configured target appears to be production, staging, shared, or unknown.

The final response must state whether critical-resource isolation was verified, changed, or blocked by an unresolved risk.

## Mandatory README command documentation

Whenever this skill creates or changes `dip.yml`, Docker Compose files, Dockerfiles, or command workflows, update the target project's `README.md` in the same task.

The README update must document the commands that actually exist after the change, including:

- Provisioning/setup command, usually `dip provision`.
- Start/stop commands, such as `dip up` and `dip down`, when implemented.
- Shell or package-manager pass-through commands, such as `dip shell`, `dip npm`, `dip pnpm`, or `dip yarn`, when implemented.
- Test, lint, database, framework CLI, or service commands, such as `dip test`, `dip lint`, `dip psql`, `dip manage`, or `dip next`, when implemented.

Keep README edits concise and aligned with the existing documentation style. If the target project has no README, create a minimal `README.md` section for local development commands.

## Mandatory Dip installation documentation

Whenever this skill creates or changes a project's `dip` workflow, update the target project's `README.md` with concise Dip installation instructions for common operating systems.

Document these options:

- macOS: Homebrew is preferred.
  ```bash
  brew tap bibendi/dip
  brew install dip
  ```
- Linux: use Homebrew on Linux when available, or install via RubyGems.
  ```bash
  brew tap bibendi/dip
  brew install dip
  ```
  ```bash
  gem install dip
  ```
- Windows: use WSL2 with a Linux distribution, then follow the Linux instructions inside WSL.
- Any OS with Ruby: `gem install dip`.

Also mention the precompiled binary option from Dip releases when Homebrew or RubyGems is not suitable, but avoid hardcoding a stale version unless the project explicitly pins one.

## Recipe: Next.js + Supabase/PostgREST

Apply when:

- `package.json` exists and dependencies include `next`.
- Supabase is detected by any of:
  - dependency `@supabase/supabase-js`
  - a `supabase/` directory
  - environment variables such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, or `DATABASE_URL`

Goal:

- A fresh checkout should be runnable with one command: `dip provision`.
- `dip provision` should build images, install dependencies, prepare local env files when missing, start local database services, apply available SQL migrations, and leave the app running.

Target files (create if missing, merge carefully if present):

- `.dockerdev/Dockerfile.dev`
- `.dockerdev/compose.yml`
- `dip.yml`
- `.dockerdev/.env.example` (only add missing local-development variables)

Recommended defaults:

- App service name: `app`
- Database service name: `db`
- PostgREST service name: `rest`
- Node image: `node:22-bookworm-slim`
- Working dir: `/app`
- App port: `${NEXT_PORT:-3000}:3000`
- Postgres port: `${POSTGRES_PORT:-54322}:5432`
- PostgREST port: `${POSTGREST_PORT:-54321}:3000`
- Bind mount the project directory.
- Use Docker volumes for `node_modules`, `.next`, and database data.
- Run Next.js as `npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0` when `dev` script is present.

Package manager detection:

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` -> use `corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; command prefix `pnpm`
- `yarn.lock` -> use `corepack enable && yarn install --frozen-lockfile`; command prefix `yarn`
- `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` -> use `npm ci`; command prefix `npm`
- otherwise -> use `npm install`; command prefix `npm`

Dockerfile.dev template:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-bookworm-slim

WORKDIR /app

ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

RUN apt-get update -qq \
  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates openssl postgresql-client \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

CMD ["sleep", "infinity"]
```

compose.yml template:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: .dockerdev/Dockerfile.dev
    command: npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0
    working_dir: /app
    ports:
      - "${NEXT_PORT:-3000}:3000"
    volumes:
      - ..:/app
      - node_modules:/app/node_modules
      - next_cache:/app/.next
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED: "1"
      DATABASE_URL: ${DATABASE_URL:-postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres}
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL:-http://localhost:54321}
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:-local-anon-key}
      SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY:-local-service-role-key}
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
      rest:
        condition: service_started

  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    ports:
      - "${POSTGRES_PORT:-54322}:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres -d postgres"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 20

  rest:
    image: postgrest/postgrest:v12.2.8
    ports:
      - "${POSTGREST_PORT:-54321}:3000"
    environment:
      PGRST_DB_URI: postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
      PGRST_DB_SCHEMAS: public
      PGRST_DB_ANON_ROLE: anon
      PGRST_JWT_SECRET: ${SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET:-local-development-jwt-secret-change-me}
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy

volumes:
  node_modules:
  next_cache:
  postgres_data:
```

If the app uses Supabase Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions, or relies on Supabase's `/rest/v1` gateway path, do not pretend plain PostgREST is a complete Supabase replacement. In that case, keep the Next.js `app` service but configure `dip provision` to call the official Supabase CLI workflow (`supabase start`, `supabase db reset`, etc.) and document that Docker plus Supabase CLI are required on the host.

For standalone PostgREST mode, add an idempotent database bootstrap before migrations:

```sql
create role anon nologin;
grant usage on schema public to anon;
grant select, insert, update, delete on all tables in schema public to anon;
alter default privileges in schema public grant select, insert, update, delete on tables to anon;
```

`dip.yml` command set should include:

- `provision`: create `.dockerdev/.env` from `.dockerdev/.env.example` when missing, build images, install dependencies, start `db` and `rest`, wait for Postgres, apply SQL files from `supabase/migrations/*.sql` or `db/migrations/*.sql` when present, and start `app`.
- `up`: start the app stack.
- `down`: stop the app stack.
- `shell`: open shell in `app`.
- package-manager pass-through command (`npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`).
- `next`: run Next.js CLI through the detected package manager.
- `lint`: run configured lint script.
- `test`: run `test` script when present, otherwise omit or map to the closest configured test/regression script.
- `psql`: open `psql` against local Postgres.

Recommended `dip.yml` shape:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bibendi/dip/refs/heads/master/schema.json
version: '8.0'

compose:
  files:
    - .dockerdev/compose.yml
  project_name: my-next-app

interaction:
  shell:
    description: Open a shell in the app container
    service: app
    command: bash
    compose:
      run_options: [no-deps]

  npm:
    description: Run npm in the app container
    service: app
    command: npm
    compose:
      run_options: [no-deps]

  next:
    description: Run Next.js CLI
    service: app
    command: npm exec next

  lint:
    description: Run lint
    service: app
    command: npm run lint

  psql:
    description: Open local Postgres
    service: db
    command: psql -U postgres -d postgres

provision:
  - test -f .dockerdev/.env || cp .dockerdev/.env.example .dockerdev/.env
  - dip compose build
  - dip compose run --rm app npm ci
  - dip compose up -d db rest
  - dip compose exec db sh -lc 'until pg_isready -U postgres -d postgres; do sleep 1; done'
  - dip compose exec db psql -U postgres -d postgres -c 'do $$ begin create role anon nologin; exception when duplicate_object then null; end $$;'
  - dip compose exec db psql -U postgres -d postgres -c 'grant usage on schema public to anon; grant select, insert, update, delete on all tables in schema public to anon; alter default privileges in schema public grant select, insert, update, delete on tables to anon;'
  - if ls supabase/migrations/*.sql >/dev/null 2>&1; then for f in supabase/migrations/*.sql; do dip compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d postgres < "$f"; done; fi
  - if ls db/migrations/*.sql >/dev/null 2>&1; then for f in db/migrations/*.sql; do dip compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d postgres < "$f"; done; fi
  - dip compose up -d app
```

Adjust the example before writing it:

- Replace `project_name` with a sanitized value from `package.json` `name`.
- Replace package-manager commands according to lockfile detection.
- If no `lint` script exists, omit `lint`.
- If no useful `test` script exists, omit `test` and mention which scripts were available.
- If `next.config.*` includes custom image or env settings, leave them unchanged.
- If a project already has `.env.example`, copy only missing local-development keys into `.dockerdev/.env.example` and never overwrite secrets.
- Keep placeholder Supabase keys clearly local-only unless real keys already exist in ignored `.env` files.

## Recipe: Node.js

Apply when `package.json` is present and Rails/Django/Next.js are not detected.

Target files (create under `.dockerdev/` if missing):

- `.dockerdev/compose.yml` (or merge into existing compose file)
- `.dockerdev/Dockerfile.dev`
- `dip.yml`

Recommended defaults:

- Service name: `app`
- Working dir: `/app`
- Bind mount project directory
- `node_modules` Docker volume
- Container command for dev server if script exists, otherwise idle command

`dip.yml` command set should include:

- `provision`: install dependencies (`npm ci` or package-manager equivalent)
- `shell`: open shell in app service
- `npm`: pass-through package manager command
- `test`: run project tests
- `lint`: run project linter if configured

## Recipe: Django

Apply when Django is detected and Rails is not detected.

Target files (create under `.dockerdev/` if missing):

- `.dockerdev/compose.yml` with:
  - `web` service for Django app
  - `db` service (PostgreSQL) when project requires database
- `.dockerdev/Dockerfile.dev`
- `dip.yml`

Recommended defaults:

- `web` command: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
- Code mounted into container
- Persistent volume for database data

`dip.yml` command set should include:

- `provision`: install Python dependencies and run migrations
- `shell`: shell in `web`
- `manage`: pass-through to `python manage.py`
- `test`: run Django tests (`python manage.py test`)

## Recipe: Generic Python (non-Django)

Configure `dip` for dependency install, shell, and tests using project's package manager and test tooling.

## Unknown stack behavior

If no known stack is detected:

- Explain what was checked.
- Ask the user which stack to target.
- Offer to scaffold a minimal generic `dip` setup once stack is confirmed.

## Output format to user

Always include:

1. Detected stack and evidence.
2. Files created/updated.
3. Configuration location, especially root `dip.yml` and supporting files under `.dockerdev/`.
4. Exact commands to run next (for example: `dip provision`, `dip up`, `dip test`).
5. Critical-resource isolation check result.
6. README Dip installation and command documentation added or updated.
7. Any assumptions requiring user confirmation.
